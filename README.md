# ghw-jamstack-resources

Join Ryan Lay, Coach at MLH, for this workshop designed to help you create fast, modern, and efficient documentation for your projects using the JAMStack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) architecture.

Presentation style and structure borrowed heavily and inspired by Pamela's [python-talks repo](https://github.com/pamelafox/my-py-talks/tree/main).
